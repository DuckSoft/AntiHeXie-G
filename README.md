# AntiHeXie-G
(FreeBasic Based) the Killer of Hash-oriented HeXie of Netdisk, Windows GUI

## What is this for?
**AntiHeXie** is a simple tool to bypass the **hash-oriented** censorship system of *some* netdisks (BaiduYun, Weiyun, blahblahblah) by modifying the files in a simple way. 

## How does this work?
**AntiHeXie** attaches a block of random-lengthed character 0x00, making the hash of the file change and thus it works.

## Does this work on all occasions?
Considering the mecanism of this program, it's obvious that **this program** *works only when the file format is not sensitive to the additional blank block of the file tail*. 

Please do remember that, this program should only works as a **makeshift**. To solve the problem radically, simply turn to other data storage solutions.

And you should **make backups** before trying my program. There is absolutely no warranty!
